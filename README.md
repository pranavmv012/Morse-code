Morse code on STM32L432 ARMcortex M4, with Embedded C


Wire and code an embedded system that flashes your initials on your RGB Led in International    Morse code. To do so, 

* A dot takes 500ms, 
* A dash takes 1500ms, 
* The space between parts of the same letter takes 500ms, 
* The space between two letters is 1500ms, 
* The space between consecutive initials takes 2500ms. 

For displaying your initials, you are going to use RGB LED in red and green. Excited by PB4, the red color of your RGB LED displays your first name initial in Morse code, and the green color of your RGB LED, which is excited by PB5, displays your last name initial in Morse code. You basically hardcode your initials within your code for your own initials.
